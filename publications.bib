  abstract	= "The ability for an information-fusion system to track and
		  identify potentially multiple objects in a dynamic
		  environment is essential for many applications, such as
		  automated surveillance, traffic monitoring, human-robot
		  interaction, etc. The main challenge is due to the noisy
		  and incomplete perception including inevitable false
		  negative and false positive errors, usually originated from
		  some low-level sensors or detectors. To address this
		  challenge, we propose a novel particle filtering over sets
		  based approach to multi-object tracking and identification.
		  We model the multi-object tracking problem as a hidden
		  Markov model with states and observations represented as
		  finite sets. We then develop motion and observation
		  functions accordingly, and do the inference via particle
		  filtering. The corresponding object identification problem
		  is then formulated and solved by using the
		  expectation-maximization method. The set formulation
		  enables us to avoid directly performing
		  observation-to-object association. We empirically confirm
		  that the proposed algorithm outperforms the
		  state-of-the-art in a popular PETS dataset."
